## Introduction

This comprehensive checklist outlines the key capabilities required for fully autonomous cleaning and maintenance management systems. While the actual cleaning and maintenance work may still require human labor, this framework focuses on automating the complex orchestration of vendors, scheduling, quality control, compliance, and business operations.

To achieve complete automation of cleaning and maintenance management, systems must demonstrate robust handling of routine operations as well as complex edge cases. The checklist below details both standard features and challenging scenarios that autonomous systems should address - from basic scheduling to handling emergency situations, from routine vendor management to complex multi-party dispute resolution.

The main categories are:
1. Property Understanding: Digital twin creation including property data, assets, surfaces, and mapping
2. Task Requirements: Define and manage work needs based on property data and client preferences
3. Vendor Management: Coordinate service providers with cost/timing optimization
4. Schedule Management: Handle job scheduling and edge cases
5. Quality Control: Verify work completion and standards
6. Property Updates: Maintain records of completed work, inventory, and condition changes
7. Financial Operations: Handle all payment processing
8. Third-Party Integrations: Connect with external systems

Companies can use this framework to:
1. Assess their current level of management automation
2. Identify gaps in their autonomous capabilities
3. Plan development roadmaps for increasing automation
4. Benchmark against industry standards
5. Validate their systems' ability to handle edge cases

Each category includes specific criteria and edge cases that must be handled without human intervention to be considered fully autonomous. The checklist is designed to be comprehensive while remaining flexible enough to accommodate different business models and regulatory environments. 

This list is comprehensive, and humans are not necessarily good at all of it. An autonomous system really needs to only be good at most of these things to be similar to a typical human in capability. Being good at all of them would make them better than effectively all humans.

Below is a revised version of the checklist with each task written to be detailed and specific to cleaning and maintenance management. Tasks that were too generic have been refined or rephrased for clarity.

### Vendor Submissions
To have your information considered, please complete a PR which contains at the minimum the name of your system, a description of your system, and a demo or other way to validate that your system can do as you describe.

### Checklist Improvements
If you have a suggestion to improve the checklist, please create a PR with your change. Any suggestions are welcome. We recommend being more specific with tasks, and less general.
