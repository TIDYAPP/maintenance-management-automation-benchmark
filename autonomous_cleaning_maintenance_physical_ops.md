II. Autonomous Cleaning Operations

A. Robotic Navigation & Obstacle Avoidance
    - [ ] Implement dynamic path planning in varied environments.
    - [ ] Integrate sensors (LIDAR, cameras) to detect obstacles.
    - [ ] Navigate around unexpected obstacles (e.g., temporary furniture changes).
    - [ ] Adapt to environmental changes like spilled liquids affecting sensor readings.

B. Self-Monitoring & Maintenance
    - [ ] Perform onboard diagnostics for battery, sensor functionality, and cleaning effectiveness.
    - [ ] Conduct automated self-cleaning or maintenance routines.
    - [ ] Handle battery depletion during operation.
    - [ ] Recover from sensor malfunction mid-task.

C. Performance & Quality Control
    - [ ] Adjust cleaning intensity based on detected dirt levels via feedback loops.
    - [ ] Perform automated quality checks using visual or sensor-based metrics.
    - [ ] Handle extreme dirt levels or unusual stains not covered by standard protocols.

D. Safety Protocols & Remote Overrides
    - [ ] Implement emergency stop mechanisms.
    - [ ] Provide remote override capability for human intervention.
    - [ ] Handle communication failure during an emergency.
    - [ ] Resolve conflicts between programmed safety protocols and real-world obstacles.

III. Autonomous Plumbing Operations

A. Diagnostics & Leak Detection
    - [ ] Integrate sensors to monitor water flow, pressure, and leaks.
    - [ ] Send automated alerts and diagnostics for early leak detection.
    - [ ] Handle intermittent leaks or false positives from sensor anomalies.

B. Automated Shutoff & Repair Guidance
    - [ ] Automatically shut off water supply in emergencies.
    - [ ] Provide guided repair routines using robotic or remote-controlled tools.
    - [ ] Handle simultaneous multiple leak scenarios.
    - [ ] Ensure the shutoff mechanism works under extreme pressure.

C. Robotic Assistance for Repairs
    - [ ] Perform minor repairs autonomously (e.g., tightening fittings, cleaning blockages).
    - [ ] Integrate with diagnostic systems for targeted intervention.
    - [ ] Handle inaccessible leak locations or complex pipe configurations requiring human intervention.

D. Compliance & Safety Standards
    - [ ] Adhere to local plumbing codes and safety regulations.
    - [ ] Perform regular system audits and fail-safe mechanisms.
    - [ ] Handle unauthorized modifications or sensor misreadings that could lead to safety risks.

IV. Additional Categories (Example: HVAC, Electrical Maintenance, etc.)

For each new category, use a similar structure:
    - [ ] Management & Scheduling Automation
    - [ ] Autonomous Operational Performance
    - [ ] Diagnostics & Self-Maintenance
    - [ ] Safety Protocols & Compliance
    - [ ] Edge Case Handling

V. Certification Levels & Scoring System

- Calculate the percentage of tasks completed from the checklist above.
- Assign a certification level based on the percentage:
    - 0-25%: Basic
    - 26-50%: Intermediate
    - 51-75%: Advanced
    - 76-100%: Full Autonomy

This structure provides a modular and scalable checklist. Companies can add detailed criteria and edge-case examples as they refine the certification process for each specific operational area. Let me know which parts youâ€™d like to expand further.
